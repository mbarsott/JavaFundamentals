 # JavaFundamentals

This project intends to quickly show you or remind you the Java syntax and usage for many common constructs and standard Java libraries.

There are explanations as comments inside the code.

Source files are named in a way you can quickly locate the subject you are searching for.

They are also numbered, so they show up in order inside your folder and you can locate them in the Table of contents.
 
 The very first file, JF01_TheBasics, is in the source root (`src`) folder. The others are under 
 `com/fledger/javafundamentals`.

Table of contents:

1. `JF01_TheBasics`: comments, statements, class, and entry point
2. `JF02_Packages`: packages and imports
3. `JF03_VarsTypesOperators`: variables, literals, types, and arithmethic operators
